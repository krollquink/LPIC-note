 Managing Files.

Naming Files
-Uppercase and Lowecase OK
-.,-,_ is OK, backup file end with ~ 
-Space can be insert in filename but need to escape with \
-cant be used in filenames: * ? / \" --> can create but better avoid because can cause confusion
-filename length depend on filesystem ext2fs,ext3fs,ext4fs,XFS,Btrfs ,etc--> limit 255 char
-.xxxx can be extension
-file started with . is hidden file

-./ = current directory
- ../ = parent directory
-FILE IS CASE_SENSITIVE



WILDCARD EXPANSION

? - single character
b?g = big,bog,bog
* - matches any character
b**k = book, biik 
() = match and character in set or range

b(ok)s = bos, bks
b(a-z) = ba,bb,bc,bd....


File Command

ls = list file
 -F Display file type
 -l long list
 -a all
 --color show color listing
 -d directory
 -R recursive

pwd = show current directory

cp = copies file
 -R recursive (usually use to copy directory)
 -f force 
 -i interactive mode(will askk comfirmation)
 -a archive (preserve permission and link)
 -u update if there any changes

mv = move file (also use for replace)
#mv in same filsystem is fast, in different filesystem is slow

rm = remove files
 -r/R recursive(use to remove directory)
 -f force
 -i interactive mode

touch = change timestamp of files
 -a change access time only
 -m change modification time only
 -c do not create file that already exist
 -t set time specified



ARCHIVING FILE

tar = archive file
 --create/c create archive
 --concatenate/ A append tar file to archive
 --append/r Appen non-tar to archive
 --update/u append files that are newr than those in an archive
 --diff/--compare/d compare archive to files in disk
 --list/t list archive contents
 --extract/x extract files from archive
 z compress file using gzip/ugzip
 j compress using bzip
 v verbose
 f file

ussualy use
tar xf [tar-file] = extract file
tar czf = compress and archive file


cpio = aarchive file (same with tar)

-cpio has three operating mode
-Copy-out mode = -o/--create creates an archive and copies files into it
-Copy-in mode = -i/--extract  extract data from existing archive(extract only that file iff the name match the pattern)
-Copy-Pass mode = -p/--pass-through cimbines copy-out and copy-in mode. Copy a directory tree from one location to another

 -a reset the access time
 -A Appends data to existing archive
 -E filename use content of filename as alist of files to be extracted in copy-in
 -F filename use filename as the cpio archive file; if this ommited cpio will use stdin or stdout
 

exp=

find ./test.txt

compress or archive 
find ./test.txt | cpio -o > ~/test.cpio
find ./test.txt | cpio -o|gzip > ~/test.cpio.gz

extract
gunzip ~/test.cpio.gz
cpio -i < ~/test.cpio

gunzip -c ~/test.cpio.gz | cpio -i
