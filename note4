 Managing Files.

Naming Files
-Uppercase and Lowecase OK
-.,-,_ is OK, backup file end with ~ 
-Space can be insert in filename but need to escape with \
-cant be used in filenames: * ? / \" --> can create but better avoid because can cause confusion
-filename length depend on filesystem ext2fs,ext3fs,ext4fs,XFS,Btrfs ,etc--> limit 255 char
-.xxxx can be extension
-file started with . is hidden file

-./ = current directory
- ../ = parent directory
-FILE IS CASE_SENSITIVE



WILDCARD EXPANSION

? - single character
b?g = big,bog,bog
* - matches any character
b**k = book, biik 
() = match and character in set or range

b(ok)s = bos, bks
b(a-z) = ba,bb,bc,bd....


File Command

ls = list file
 -F Display file type
 -l long list
 -a all
 --color show color listing
 -d directory
 -R recursive

pwd = show current directory

cp = copies file
 -R recursive (usually use to copy directory)
 -f force 
 -i interactive mode(will askk comfirmation)
 -a archive (preserve permission and link)
 -u update if there any changes

mv = move file (also use for replace)
#mv in same filsystem is fast, in different filesystem is slow

rm = remove files
 -r/R recursive(use to remove directory)
 -f force
 -i interactive mode

touch = change timestamp of files
 -a change access time only
 -m change modification time only
 -c do not create file that already exist
 -t set time specified



ARCHIVING FILE

tar = archive file
 --create/c create archive
 --concatenate/ A append tar file to archive
 --append/r Appen non-tar to archive
 --update/u append files that are newr than those in an archive
 --diff/--compare/d compare archive to files in disk
 --list/t list archive contents
 --extract/x extract files from archive
 z compress file using gzip/ugzip
 j compress using bzip
 v verbose
 f file

ussualy use
tar xf [tar-file] = extract file
tar xzf [tar-file] = extract compressed file and archive
tar czf = compress and archive file


cpio = aarchive file (same with tar)

-cpio has three operating mode
-Copy-out mode = -o/--create >>creates an archive and copies files into it
-Copy-in mode = -i/--extract  >>extract data from existing archive(extract only that file iff the name match the pattern)
-Copy-Pass mode = -p/--pass-through >>combines copy-out and copy-in mode. Copy a directory tree from one location to another

 -a reset the access time
 -A Appends data to existing archive
 -E filename use content of filename as alist of files to be extracted in copy-in
 -F filename use filename as the cpio archive file; if this ommited cpio will use stdin or stdout
 

exp=

find ./test.txt

compress or archive 
find ./test.txt | cpio -o > ~/test.cpio
find ./test.txt | cpio -o|gzip > ~/test.cpio.gz

extract
gunzip ~/test.cpio.gz
cpio -i < ~/test.cpio

gunzip -c ~/test.cpio.gz | cpio -i


dd = archive file at low level
-can set partition as and output for the file(copy all to the partition)
-backup entire partition(including empty space)
-best to make an exact copy for partition

dd if=/dev/sda3 of=/dev/dvd

dd if=/dev/dvd of=/dev/sda3


TRICK
create empty file with particular size with dd===== by using /dev/zero

dd if=/dev/zero of=empty-file.img bs=1024 count=720

bs=<set block size> count=<set lengtH>

BACKING UP OPTICAL 
-need special backup

cdrecord - 

mkisofs -create ISo-9660 / UDF filesystem

tar/cpio --> mkisofs --> cdrecord (preserve permission bit)


MANAGING LINKS
-shortcut like windows
-give command multiple names
-enable programs that look for the same files in deifferent locations to access the same files.

--hard links 
   --> produced by creating two directory entries that point to the same file/same inode
   --> both file are equally valid, one is created after the another
   --> must delete both file 
   --> filesystem must support hard links
   --> must exist in single lowlvl filesystem
--soft links
--soft link(symbolic links)
   --> files is point to the linked-to file.
   --> accesing link is like accessing the original file.
   --> can go across other filesystem
   --> more common than hard links


ln = create link(create hard links by default)
 -f force option
 -i interactive comfirmation to change links
 -d hard link for directories
 -s/--symbolic create symbolic/soft links


Directory Commands

mkdir = create directory
 -m set mode /permission
 -p create parent

rmdir = delete/destroy directory only empty directory

 -p delete parent
*better use rm -r to delete directory because rmdir only delete empty directory



MANAGING FILE OWNERSHIP

user/group/all

chown (options) [newowner][:newgroup] filenames

 -R/--recursive change ownership all directories trees
*only root can use chown to change other user file. if not user can only change their files only!

chgrp [options] newgroup filenames = change group for files

 -R/--recursive 
*chgrp is set of chown





 - _____ r ___ w ___ x ___ r ___ - ____ x ___ r ___ - ___ x 
 1       2     3     4     5     6      7     8     9     10 

1 = file type code

2,3,4 = Owner permission

5,6,7 = Group permission

8,9,0 = World permission


-rwxr-xr-x.  

Special permission Bit

SUID = run the file with permission of whoever owns the file
-put s in the permission string(owner)

SGID = set group ID , similar to SUID
-put s in the permission string(group)


Sticky bit = protect file from deleted by those who don't own the files.
-indicated by t
rwxr-xr-t.



DAC,ACLs and SElinux
new system called ACL
setfacl
getfacl

Role-based access control(RBAC)
SELinux

chmod = change file mode

exp 
chmod 644 test.dat

Sticky bit - 1
SGID - 2
SUID - 4


chmod symbolic mode

u Owner   + Add            r read
g Group   - Remove         w write
o Other   = Set equal to   x Execute
a All
                           X Execute only if the file is a directory or already has execute permission
                           s SUID or SGID
                           t Sticky bits

                           u Existing owner
                           g Existng  group
                           o Existing other


chmod g-w,o-rw test.txt
chmod a+x test.txt
chmod ug=rw test.txt
chmod g=u

ONLY ROOT AND OWNER CAN CHANGE FILE PERMISSION


Setting the Default Mode and Group
-file will follow user default ownership and permissions
-default ownership and permission defines using user mask

umask = takes as input an octal value that represents bits to be removed.

exp 

umask        created files   created directory
umask 000 -->666             777


ordinary user can change their own umask
Super user can change for all user

umask insinde /etc/profile (default settings)

-S - produce umask symbolically

umask -S

u=req,g=rwx,o=rx

can be used symbolically too
exp 
umask u=rwx,g=rx,o=rx

newgrp = set default group for new file( user can use this)

Changing file attributes

chattr = change file attributes

exp of attributes
A = wont update access time
a = sets append mode, disable write azccess
c = kernel will compress data written to file and uncompress when read back
i = make the file immutable,file cant be deleted,links cant be created and cant be renamed
j = kernel will journal all data written to the file
s = completely remove the inode data(kernel will zero the data block)
t = disable tail merging(end of data blocks will be filled with other data) 


exp
chattr +i test.txt
chattr -i text.txt


Managing Disk Quotas
to manage quotas created by user
-almost all filesystem support quotas
2.4.x kernel = use quota v1 support system
2.6.x kernel and up = use quota v2 support system

quota = tools for quota v2 support system
-need to edit /etc/fstab to use quota
-need to add usrquota in fstab

--> /dev/sdc5 /home ext4 usrquota,grpquota 1 1

and need to be enable in SysV or any other init tools
exp
chkconfig quota on
quotaon

then reboot is needed
then quotacheck command

quotacheck = check quota for the filesystem and builds current disk usage data records

exp 
quotacheck -cu /home

after that set quota for user

edquota = use text editor to set user quota

exp 
edquota sally

-alter soft and hard limit for quota
-hard limit will make kernel to stop the user from passing the limit
-soft limit make user can temporarily exceed soft limits,have grace period if user exceed grace period it will treat the soft as hard.
-can set grace period using -t
edquota -t <time> = set on per-filesystem basis

edquota -g = edit quota for group

repquota -a = summarizez quota information about filesystem
quota = same as repquota,and take options to show quota information 
-g = show group
-l = omits NFS mounts
-q = limits outputs to filesystemon which usage is over limit

Locating Files

Linux FHS(FILE HIERARCHY SYSTEM)
-from FSSTND
- have shareable and non share-able file
-static and variable files
-static = program executeables
-variable = automated scripts,servers etc
FHS user this 2x2 matrix to isolate files

	 | Shareable      | Unshareable
_________|________________|____________
	 |	          |
Static	 |/usr /opt       | /etc /boot
_________|________________|____________
	 |	          |
Variable |/home /var/mail | /var/run /var/lock
_________|________________|____________

Directory Contents

/ = root directory( all directories branch from here)

/boot = static and unshareable files,related to initial booting, contains grub and lilo conf file

/etc = unsahreable and static, higher level configuration files,

/bin = contain executables file,almost never share

/sbin = contain executable file for sysadmin(fdisk,e2fsck etc)

/lib = contain program libraries
  /lib/modules = contains kernel modules

/usr = host computer programs

/usr/local = mirror the /usr, cdirectory that contains files that installs locally, exp is files that compiled locally.

/usr/share/man = contain man pages used by man command
/usr/share/local/man = local version

/usr/X11R6 = contain file realted to X windows

/opt = inted for ready made packages ,games,word precessors.

/home = user home directory

/root = home directory for root

/var = contains log,mail ,new files and o on

/tmp = temporary files,usually cleanup when booted

/mnt = mounts removable-media devices,

/media = linux treat hardware device like a file,so they put it here

/proc = created dynamically,



/boot
/home
/opt
/tmp           Ok in different partition
/usr
/usr/local
/var



/bin
/dev
/etc          Better in same partition
/lib
/sbin


Locating Files


find = brute force approach to find a file

find [path] [expression]

-name = find by patter name
-perm = find by permission
-size = find by size,can be use with letter code such as c for bytes or k for kilobytes
-gid = search file in group ID
-uid  = search file in user ID
-maxdepth  = search by depth of directory

exp 
find / -name *.txt

locate = search from database
slocate = security features of locate

whereis = show binary file directories, library directories, man page

whereis ls

which = just find path to the first match it finds	

type = tell what type the command is
