Configuring Firmware

-Well known firmware ,BIOS(Basic IN/OUT System)
-new frimware EFI/UEFI(Unified extensible Firmware interface)

-Firmware reside in EEPROM(electronically Erasable programable Read Only Memory)

firmware work flow
-->Turn on--> POST -->load bootloader --> past control to boot loader.

IRQ(Interrupt Request) = Signal send to the CPU instructing it to suspend its current activity and to handle some external event.

-in x86_64 IRQ is from 0 to 15
-modern PC provide more!
-Some IRQ already reserverd for specific purpose

0 - System Timer
1 - Keyboard
2 - Cascade for IRQs 8-15
3 - Second RS-232 serial port
4 - First RS-232 serial port
5 - Sound card or second parallel port 
6 - Floppy disk controller
7 - First parallel port
8 - Real time clock 
9 - ACPI system control interrupt (used by intel chipset for Power Management)
10 - Open intterupt
11 - Open intterupt
12 - PS/2 mouse
13 - Math coprocessor (Reserved for internal use)
14 - Primary ATA controller (/dev/hda /dev/hdb)
15 - Secondary ATA controller(/dev/hdc /dev/hdd)
* new system for Serial ATA (/dev/sda /dev/sdb)

cat /proc/interrupts = to see list of interrupts

I/O Addresses(I/O ports) = unique locations in memory that are reserved for communications between CPU and specific physical hardware(like IRQ ,cannot be shared)

cat /proc/ioports

DMA(direct memory addressing) -Hardware directly access memory without CPU

cat /proc/dma
