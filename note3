Chapter 3 Configuring Hardware

-All OS run on hardware
.

Configuring Firmware

-Well known firmware ,BIOS(Basic IN/OUT System)
-new frimware EFI/UEFI(Unified extensible Firmware interface)

-Firmware reside in EEPROM(electronically Erasable programable Read Only Memory)

firmware work flow
-->Turn on--> POST -->load bootloader --> past control to boot loader.

IRQ(Interrupt Request) = Signal send to the CPU instructing it to suspend its current activity and to handle some external event.

-in x86_64 IRQ is from 0 to 15
-modern PC provide more!
-Some IRQ already reserverd for specific purpose

0 - System Timer
1 - Keyboard
2 - Cascade for IRQs 8-15
3 - Second RS-232 serial port
4 - First RS-232 serial port
5 - Sound card or second parallel port 
6 - Floppy disk controller
7 - First parallel port
8 - Real time clock 
9 - ACPI system control interrupt (used by intel chipset for Power Management)
10 - Open intterupt
11 - Open intterupt
12 - PS/2 mouse
13 - Math coprocessor (Reserved for internal use)
14 - Primary ATA controller (/dev/hda /dev/hdb)
15 - Secondary ATA controller(/dev/hdc /dev/hdd)
* new system for Serial ATA (/dev/sda /dev/sdb)

cat /proc/interrupts = to see list of interrupts

I/O Addresses(I/O ports) = unique locations in memory that are reserved for communications between CPU and specific physical hardware(like IRQ ,cannot be shared)

cat /proc/ioports

DMA(direct memory addressing) -Hardware directly access memory without CPU

cat /proc/dma


Coldplug and hotplug

coldplug = system need to be off for plug in
hotplug = system can be on for plug in

Some tools to help user to access information and edit hardware.

1.Sysfs = mounted at /sys ,exports information about devices so that user-space can access
2. HAL-Daemon = Hardware Abstaraction Layer (hald) ,run as daemon, provides other user-space programs with information about available hardware.
3. D-Bus = Desktop Bus , run in daemon, enable proccess to commucincate with hardware, such as USB
4. /udev = mounted at /deb which creates dynamic device files as drivers are loaded and unloaded. can configure udev in /etc/udev

Configuring Expansion Cards

lspci = displays all of the information about the PCI busses in system.
-v = increase verbosity
-n = display information in numeric codes rather than translating the codes to manufacturer and device names.
-nn Displays both the manufacturer and device names and their associated numeric codes.
-s = show specific pci


Kernel Modules

-handle hardware in linux
-stored in /etc/modules
-some modules already compiled into kernel

lsmod = show modules that currently loaded into the system

Loading Kernel modules

insmod / modprobe

insmod = insert module into the kernel
	 need to load dependencies

modprobe = automatically loads any depended-on modules

insmod
exp 
insmod /lib/modules/3.16.6/kernel/drivers/bluetooth/bluetooth.ko
-require full name module
-sometimes need module options, need to refer to the documentation


modprobe 
exp 
modprobe bluetooth

-v = verbose
-C = use configuration file in /etc/modprobe.conf
-n/--dry-run = causes modprobe to perform checls and all other opertaions except module insertion.
-r = remove module
-f = froce the module loading even if the kernel version doesn't match what the module expect.
--show-dependencies = show dependecies for the module
-l = list option available form the wildcards

Removing Kernel Module

rmmod = removing module

rmmod bluetooth
-v = verbose
-f = force removal
-w = wait for the module in unused condititon before removing it

Configuring USB devices

-There are several USB controllert available 
-UHCI,OHCI,EHCI,R8A66597
-UHCI and OHCI = USB 1.0

two tools for managing USB devices:usbmgr and hotplug

usbmgr = detect usb and load module to the kernel
-but hotplug is famous

hotplug = relies on kernel support , uses files stored in/etc/hotplugto control specific USB,

COnfiguring Hard Disk

-Three Common hardisk interface
 Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment(PATA),ATA
 Serial Advanced Technology Attachment(SATA)
 Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)

++USB,IEE1394

PATA
-parallel interface,several bits is stransferred over the cable at once.
-cable are wide 
-supporting to 40 to 80 lines
-can connect up to two devices to each PATA connector,
-must be configured as MASTER and SLAVE(done via jumper)
-modern PATA support cable select
-/dev/hda /dev/hdb
-hda for master and hdb for slave
-partition hda1,hda2
-modern distibution treat PATA disks as SCSI

SATA
-FASTER than PATA
-cable much thinner

Configuring SCSI
-better than PATA
-few people use SCSI
-SCSI support 8-16
-sometimes SCSI adapter have their own firmware
-numbering is depend on SCSI ID
-lowest to highest

Design Hard Disk Layout
-create partition and format!
-Why partiton
--Multiple OS support
--Filesystem choice
--Disk Space management
--Disk Error protection
--Security
--Backup


Partitioning Systems
-Usually MBR
---data stored in the first sector of the disks
---size is very limited (2tebibytes)=2^40 bytes=512Byte
-the successor is GUID Partition Table


MBR partition
x64 system only allowed 4 partition
-but hard disk become bigger and make this new partition scheme
-PRimary
 -same as the original partition
-Extended
 -special type of primary partition that serve as placeholder for the next type
-Logical
 -reside within an extended partition

primary partition = 1-->4
logical partition = 5-->up
gap cannot exist in logical partition

MBR HOLD partition table and boot loader
-very sensitive and important
-have type code
--0x0c = FAT,0x05= old type extended partition 0x07 = NTFS ,0x82 = Linux swap, 0x83 = filesystem

GPT 
part of intel EFI spec
-can be use in PC that doesnt use EFI
-preferred in partitioning system on disks bigger than 2Tib
-employs protective MBR
-make utilities unaware of GPT
-additional data structures define GPT
-this data sturctures lies in start of disk and end of disk

--CAN create up to 128 partitions(may be raise if necessary)
--gap can occur in partition number 
-drawbacks is support for it is immature

Alternative to PARTITION
-LVM(logical volume management)
-use pvreate,vgcreate,lvcreate,lvscan to manage physical volumes(partition)
-combine partition into one big volume group
-assign them into /dev/mapper
-filsesystem size can be change!!

Mount Points
-After partition is created, it must be mount before use
