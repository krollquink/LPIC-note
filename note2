Managing Software

Package Concepts
-Linux package managemnet tools are intended to help build and modify this programs based on:
1. Package = contain information about software packages, 
	-usually distributed as single files
	-once installed in consist of dozens or hundreds of files
	-incluse additional information for package management systems
2. Installed File Database = include all information about every file installed via package system,

3. Dependencies = requirements of package for one another

4. Checksums - used to verify the validity of the installed software

5. Upgrades and Uninstallation = package management systems will track upgrades and uninstall

6. Binary package Creation = got tools to create package form source code. 


USING RPM!!

-Red hat package management 
-been used by many linux Distro
RPM PACKAGE = packagename-a.b.c-x.arch.rpm

Above contain
-Package name
-Version Number
-Build number
-Architecture

In Ideal world RPM will install and run on any RPM distro that uses an appropriate CPU type.BUT!!!
-distro may be use other version of RPM
-RPM designed for other distro maybe using a different library
-distro maybe named the package differently
-sometimes package contain slightly different file
-some programs contain disto-specific file or script/configuration

IT safe to use YUM(Yellow Dog Updater) to install rpm package!
