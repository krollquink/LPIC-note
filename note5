Configuring The X Window System,Localization and Printing

Configuring Basic X Features

Basic X specifies features such as mouse used, keyboard layout,screen resolution,video refresh rate ,color depth and video card installed.

-Some of this need us to tell X what are we using

X Server Options for Linux

1. XFree86 = 
    -dominant till 2004
    -open source server 
    -support varieties of video card
    -most software designed based on this
    -significant changed from 3.x to 4.x

2. X.org-X11 = 
    - many change to this after XFree license change
    - most of it is identical to Xfree

3. Accelerated-X = 
    -Commercial version of X


Basically just stick to Distro provides

Method of Configuring X

X Configuration Utilites(use utility tools)
-we can use utility tools to setting X

1. X server itself
-include capacity to query the hardware and produce a configuration file.

Comm
--> XFree86 -configure
--> Xorg -configure

*not producing good result ,but good for minimal modifications

2. Distro specific tools

Comm
-->system-config-display = accessible from default desktop menu

3. xf86cfg xorgcfg = utility(this tools is deprecated)


X Configuration file format.

X.org-X11 = called xorg.conf
-stored in /etc/X11 

XFree86 4.x = called XF86Config
-stored in /etc/X11 
-same conf as X.org

XFree86 3.x = called XF86Config 
-stored in /etc/X11 
-same as XFree86 3.x but slightly different

all conf file break the section to big section and each sechtion consisting the keywoed "Section"  and end with "EndSection:"

example 
Section "Input Device"
    Identifier "Keyboard0" <-- provides a label that will be used by other section
    Driver     "kbd" <-- Tells X what driver to use to access the keyboard
    Option     "XkbModel" "pc105" <-- set additional option for X
    Option     "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option     "AutoRepeat" "500 200"
EndSection

If our Xorg have problem, modify configuration and test it.
-best way to test is to reboot the pc
-or change the system into a mode in which X is not started automatically( use telinit 3)
-Some distribution need to close the GUI login server depending on config
--->text-based login --> configure Xorg conf --> startx(use telinit 5 | /etc/init.d/xdm start for Debian and other distro that didnt use runlevels to start GUI)

-can use ps ax | grep X to kill X inside X-enabled runlevel

X Configuration Options

-Module, InputDevice,Monitor,Device,Screen, ServerLayout
-InputDevice likely to have to section for mouse and keyboard

Configuring X Fonts

-configure X's core font can be set up at X conf file
-you can configure a font server

Font Technologies and Format

1.  Bitmap Fonts 
-represent fonts like bitmap graphics
-where individual pixels in an array are either active or inactive
-need multiple files to display font at mutiple sizes and different displays

2. Outline Fonts (Scalable fonts)
-Modern type of file, all formats represents eahc character as a series of lines and curves in a high-resolution matrix.
-can scale in any size and display
-take CPU time

example: Adobe PostScript Type 1, Apple's TrueType

X11 support both font


Configuring X Core Fonts

-X core fonts is fonts that are handled directly by X.
need to:
1.prepare font directory
    -X11  save in /usr/share/fonts or /usr share/X11/fonts
    -Type 1 fonts , named with .pfa or .pfb
    - TrueType come as .ttf
2.Add font directory to X's font path
    -prepare summary files for that describes the fonts.
    -called fonts.dir
    -can be created automaticallyusing
    #mkfontscale - reads all the fonts in the current directory and creates a fonts.scale same like fonts.dir but only descrives outline fonts.
    #mkfontdir combines the fonts.scale with the fonts.dir,creatting if it doesn't already exist


ttmkfdir - create fonts.dir for TrueType
tpe1inst - create fonts.dir for Type 1

Configuring Font Server

-set font server for Linux
-not a practice anymore
-to use font server, X must list that server in its font path:
example:

Section "Files"
    FontPath "unix:/7100"
    Fontpath "tcp/fount.pangaea/edu:7100" <-- specifies font server 
EndSection

font server is confifure using catalogue in /etc/X11/fs/configo
example

catalogue = /usr/share/fonts/100dpi:unscaled,
            /usr/share/fonts/Type1,
            /usr/share/fonts/TrueType,

restart X after change settings


Why X core font suck
-not easy to integrate screen display and printed output, awkward to use in application
-theyre server-based, some application may not able to access the font files
-provide limited or no support for kerning and other advanced typographic features
-the dont support font smoothing

SO they change to new system

Xft FONTS!!

Xft fonts solve problem X core font have

fc-cache - causes X to run through all dir and create index files

Configuring Localization and Internationalization

Settings up time zone

change /etc/localtime to time from /usr/share/zoneinfo
change /etc/timezone to time from /usr/share/zoneinfo -- Debian
change /etc/sysconfig/clock to time from /usr/share/zoneinfo -- Fedora

-can use cp or ln -s 

change individual time zone

TZ = variable for time zone in any of 3 formats
    -:filename 
    -std offset - example EST +5
    -daylight saving time in effect :std offset dst[offset]


Settings up Locale
-settings up computer's language,country and realted information for purpose of customizing displays

locale format : 
[language[_territory][.codeset][@modifier]]

language = jp,en,fr
territory = US,FR,JP
.codeset = ASCII,UTF-8
modifier = locale-specific code

Where is Locale file

in /usr/bin/locale or jsut run locale command

locale -a = show all locale that available to you

Changing Locale :

change locale by changing variable
exp:
export LANG=en_GB.UTF-8 -- change only for the session
to permanently change is to edit ~/.bashrc or /etc/profile


Modifying Text-File Locales
-change file encoding 

iconv -f encoding [ -t encoding] [inputfile] ..

exp 
iconv -f iso-8859 -t UTF-8 umlautfile.txt > umlautfile-utf8.txt




Linux Printing Architecture

-Linux printing is built around Print queue
-use lpr to print
-queue is correspond to directory on the hard disk, in /var/spool/cups
-CUPS is daemon run in background
-CUPS can act as sand client passing print jobs to other PC in network
-Application can query CUPS for printer information



Understanding PostScript/Ghostscript

Postscript = printer language for Linux (from Unix era)
-not designed for Windows
-linux generate PostScript and sent the results to printer queue
-some programs can produce PostScript or Printer Control Language(PCL)
-the problem is that it uncommon  and need Ghostscript to translate to fit that translator!! This is where we need Ghostscript

Ghostscript = PostScript interpreter that change PostScript to output any of dozens of different printer format
-the problem is Ghostscript produce a large output of files.
