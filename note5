Configuring The X Window System,Localization and Printing

Configuring Basic X Features

Basic X specifies features such as mouse used, keyboard layout,screen resolution,video refresh rate ,color depth and video card installed.

-Some of this need us to tell X what are we using

X Server Options for Linux

1. XFree86 = 
    -dominant till 2004
    -open source server 
    -support varieties of video card
    -most software designed based on this
    -significant changed from 3.x to 4.x

2. X.org-X11 = 
    - many change to this after XFree license change
    - most of it is identical to Xfree

3. Accelerated-X = 
    -Commercial version of X


Basically just stick to Distro provides

Method of Configuring X

X Configuration Utilites(use utility tools)
-we can use utility tools to setting X

1. X server itself
-include capacity to query the hardware and produce a configuration file.

Comm
--> XFree86 -configure
--> Xorg -configure

*not producing good result ,but good for minimal modifications

2. Distro specific tools

Comm
-->system-config-display = accessible from default desktop menu

3. xf86cfg xorgcfg = utility(this tools is deprecated)


X Configuration file format.

X.org-X11 = called xorg.conf
-stored in /etc/X11 

XFree86 4.x = called XF86Config
-stored in /etc/X11 
-same conf as X.org

XFree86 3.x = called XF86Config 
-stored in /etc/X11 
-same as XFree86 3.x but slightly different

all conf file break the section to big section and each sechtion consisting the keywoed "Section"  and end with "EndSection:"

example 
Section "Input Device"
    Identifier "Keyboard0" <-- provides a label that will be used by other section
    Driver     "kbd" <-- Tells X what driver to use to access the keyboard
    Option     "XkbModel" "pc105" <-- set additional option for X
    Option     "XkbLayout" "us"
    Option     "AutoRepeat" "500 200"
EndSection

If our Xorg have problem, modify configuration and test it.
-best way to test is to reboot the pc
-or change the system into a mode in which X is not started automatically( use telinit 3)
-Some distribution need to close the GUI login server depending on config
--->text-based login --> configure Xorg conf --> startx(use telinit 5 | /etc/init.d/xdm start for Debian and other distro that didnt use runlevels to start GUI)

-can use ps ax | grep X to kill X inside X-enabled runlevel

X Configuration Options

-Module, InputDevice,Monitor,Device,Screen, ServerLayout
-InputDevice likely to have to section for mouse and keyboard
